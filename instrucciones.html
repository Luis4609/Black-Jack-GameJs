    <h1>Instrucciones Blackjack</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <ol>
            <li> Start a new round by pressing 'New round'</li>
            <li>The dealer reveals one card for himself and 2 for your hand</li>
            <li>You can choose one of two options:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hit:</b> the dealer deals you an additional card to your hand, increasing your hand value. <br>You
                        may
                        hit until
                        you either choose to stand or exceed 21 in hand value, in which case you lose.</li>
                    <li><b>Stand:</b> you are no longer dealt additional cards and the dealer draws cards until he has at least
                        17
                        points or exceeds 21</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once all the cards are dealt, the hand values are scored and the winner is determined</li>
            <li>You win if:
                <ul>
                    <li>Your hand value does not exceed 21 and your dealer's hand value exceeds 21</li>
                    <li>Your hand value does not exceed 21 and your hand value is higher than the dealer's</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
        </ol>
